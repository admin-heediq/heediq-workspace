## Entries

### Infrastructure (heediq-infra)
- **Upstream**: AWS accounts (D-045), locked decisions on naming/sizing/DNS/SES (D-037, D-038, D-051–D-058)
- **Downstream**: all app repos — they deploy code on top of infra resources; all SSM params from FoundationStack must exist before app deploys succeed; `GitHubActionsECRRole` in shared-services account is used by all app repos to push Docker images
- **Shared surfaces**:
  - `lib/config.ts` — account IDs, regions, domains, compute sizing; any change ripples to all stacks
  - `scripts/setup-aws-profiles.sh` — configures AWS SSO profiles for all 4 accounts; owner-only, run once per new machine
  - `scripts/setup.sh` — one-time AWS setup (CDK bootstrap + OIDC providers + IAM roles); upstream for all repos' CI. Must be re-run if org is renamed or trust policy drifts.
  - `scripts/setup-budgets.sh` — creates AWS Budgets via management account

### Transcription pipeline (TranscriptionStack)
- **Upstream**: FoundationStack (SQS `heediq-transcription`, S3 `heediq-audio-uploads-*`, DynamoDB `heediq-jobs` + `heediq-recordings`); SharedServicesStack (ECR repo `heediq-worker-transcription` with AllowWorkloadAccountPull policy)
- **Downstream**: `heediq-worker-transcription` (Python EC2 GPU Spot — image deployed by that repo's CI, D-059); SummarizationStack (triggered after job status set to done); WebSocket status push via Status Pusher Lambda + DDB Streams on `heediq-jobs` (D-061)
- **Shared surfaces**: `heediq-jobs` table (written by EC2 GPU task, read by Status Pusher Lambda + API); `heediq-recordings` table (updated by EC2 GPU task); ECR repo (shared pull path with future workers)

### WebSocket real-time status (WebSocketStack)
- **Upstream**: FoundationStack (heediq-jobs DDB Streams stream ARN; heediq-ws-connections table; wildcardCert — ACM wildcard cert eu-west-1, D-063); Cognito (JWKS for JWT validation in Connection Lambda)
- **Downstream**: heediq-web (connects via wss://ws-{env}.heediq.com; receives status push events); heediq-api (Connection Lambda code deployed by heediq-api CI per D-050)
- **Shared surfaces**: heediq-ws-connections table (written by Connect Lambda, read by Status Pusher Lambda); heediq-jobs DDB Streams (read-only by Status Pusher Lambda); SSM /heediq/api/ws-endpoint-url (read by heediq-web and heediq-api)

### Summarization pipeline (SummarizationStack)
- **Upstream**: FoundationStack (heediq-jobs + heediq-recordings DynamoDB tables; heediq-audio-uploads S3 bucket); SummarizationStack (heediq-summarization SQS queue — created here, consumed by Lambda event source)
- **Downstream**: `heediq-worker-summarization` (Node Lambda — placeholder in stack; real implementation deployed by that repo's CI, D-043); `heediq-api` (reads structured output from heediq-recordings); `heediq-web` (displays extraction results)
- **Shared surfaces**:
  - `heediq-summarization` SQS queue — written by TranscriptionStack EC2 task role (audio path) + ApiStack Lambda (direct non-audio path, D-065, D-026); consumed by summarization Lambda
  - `heediq-jobs` table — written by summarization Lambda (status: `summarizing → done/failed`); also written by transcription worker + read by Status Pusher Lambda
  - `heediq-recordings` table — written by summarization Lambda (structured extraction fields); also written by transcription worker + read by ApiStack Lambda
  - `heediq-audio-uploads-*` S3 bucket — read by summarization Lambda (transcript + direct-path content files); also written by API (presigned URL upload)

### Web frontend delivery (WorkloadCfCertStack + WebStack)
- **Upstream**: FoundationStack (heediq-web-assets-{accountId} S3 bucket — OAC bucket policy grant added there; wildcardCert not used here); WorkloadCfCertStack (us-east-1 ACM cert via crossRegionReferences prop, D-053); SharedServicesStack (heediq-route53-dns-manager role for Route53AliasRecord D-064); `lib/config.ts → DOMAINS` (web domain per env)
- **Downstream**: heediq-web (React SPA — served from CloudFront; CI does S3 sync + `aws cloudfront create-invalidation` using `/heediq/web/cloudfront-distribution-id` SSM param); heediq-api (reads `/heediq/web/url` SSM param for CORS origin)
- **Shared surfaces**:
  - `heediq-web-assets-{accountId}` S3 bucket — written by heediq-web CI; served by CloudFront via OAC (source-account policy in FoundationStack)
  - `/heediq/web/url` SSM param — consumed by heediq-api (CORS) and heediq-web (runtime config)
  - `/heediq/web/cloudfront-distribution-id` SSM param — consumed by heediq-web CI for cache invalidation
  - **Key CDK constraint**: OAC bucket policy must live in FoundationStack (source-account condition), not WebStack — avoids circular cross-stack reference. `s3.Bucket.fromBucketName()` in WebStack prevents CDK from adding a second bucket policy.

### Recording (capture)
- Upstream: auth/onboarding, UI kit (Listen button)
- Downstream: transcription pipeline, recordings library
- Shared surfaces: recordings DynamoDB table, S3 audio bucket
